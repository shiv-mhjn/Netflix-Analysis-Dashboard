# Byte Blossom_048

Byte Blossom_048 is a movie analytics dashboard designed using Power BI. It provides detailed insights into various movies, including their release year, average ratings, and other essential information. Data cleaning and analysis were performed using Python, and the data was loaded into the system using SQL.


## Installation

To set up the project and understand how the dataset was prepared and utilized, follow these steps:

1) Dataset Preparation
Obtain the dataset containing information about movies, such as release year, ratings, and genres.

2) Clean the data using Python to ensure it is ready for analysis:

Handle Null Values: Replace missing values with appropriate statistical measures:
Mean for numerical data (e.g., ratings).
Median for skewed numerical data (e.g., box office collections).
Mode for categorical data (e.g., genres).

3) Creating the Dashboard in Power BI
Import the dataset or connect Power BI to the SQL database.

Combine multiple tables in Power BI to create relationships and build a unified data model.

Use Power BI’s features to generate visualizations and extract valuable insights, such as:

Average ratings by genre.
Number of movies released per year.
Popular genres based on ratings.
Customize the dashboard with slicers, filters, and charts for interactivity and a user-friendly experience.
